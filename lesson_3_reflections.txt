When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?

    when I want to collaborate with the world or my team to work on the same project,
    at different places, and timezones, remote acts as a good backup for all work done.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

    more control	-you pull only branch you need,
    safe		-no unwanted modifications,
    saving traffic	-:)

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches.  When would you
use one instead of another?

    my workflow whoud look like the next:
    Fork (someone's repository) ->
    Clone (to my computer) ->
    Branch (add feature I want) ->
    Commit ->
    Push.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote
stored locally?

    you can continue working without internet conection on your project,
    one more place your project saved,
    and you are able to analyze who and what doing there,
    check the diferences, see the state of the project, and more.
