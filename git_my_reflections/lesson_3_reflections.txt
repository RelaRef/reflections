When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?

    when I want to collaborate with the world or my team to work on the same project,
    at different places, and timezones, remote acts as a good backup for all work done.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

    more control	-you pull only branch you need,
    safe		-no unwanted modifications,
    saving traffic	-:)

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches.  When would you
use one instead of another?

    my workflow whoud look like the next:
    Fork (someone's repository) ->
    Clone (to my computer) ->
    Branch (add feature I want) ->
    Commit ->
    Push.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote
stored locally?

    you can continue working without internet connection on your project,
    one more place your project is saved at,
    and you are able to analyze who is doing what there,
    check the differences, see the state of the project, and more.

How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub?  What would be easier,
and what would be harder?

    GitHub manages pull-requests, sends notifications etc. So now I learned about GitHub,
    it seems easy to work with and harder without.

When would you want to make changes in a separate branch rather than directly in
master?  What benefits does each approach have?

    branches act as labels, sandboxes, etc, allowing us to experiment with our needs
    to add features, fixes, typos, documentations, styles, etc, without breaking
    a product's main line, after successful merging and testing we can fast-forward merge
    our results to the main line called master branch.
